### Task

12-class Image Classification using Deep Learning Technique.

### Approaches

**Model: **Enhanced Convolution Neural Network

We will try to use the following technique to enhance our model.

1. SpatialPyramidPooling: Used for enabling the network to accept images with arbitrary size.
2. SaliencyELD: Used for identifying the major semantic object within a image.
3. InceptionBlock: Inspired from ResNet, we plan to use this to ease the training process.
4. SIFT: Used as a supplement for convolution features.
5. Ensemble will also be adopted to improve overall model performance.

### Notice

Place the dataset into ```data``` directory, it will not be uploaded.
